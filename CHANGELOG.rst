0.6.0
-----

A major rewrite & simplification. This version works *very* differently
from 0.5, don't expect to migrate easily.

* Time slots are now primarily for marking busy state, and
  availability occurrences are for free times.
* You have to create your own models, subclassing the abstract
  models in django_agenda.models. The good thing about this is
  that this allows us to use real foreign keys instead of
  generic ones.
* To that end, you'll have to migrate the data into your models.
  Django Agenda won't delete any of it's own models, but you'll
  have to migrate the data into the new models that you make.
* Booking validation is now done in AbstractBooking.clean
  instead of AbstractBooking.save. Make sure you call full_clean!
* You can use django_agenda.models.get_free_times to find all the
  free time spans in a particular space of time.
